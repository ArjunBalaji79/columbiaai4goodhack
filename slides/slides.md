<div>

### People

- **Who:** Emergency operators, first responders, disaster-affected communities
- **Problem:** Contradictory signals cause delayed decisions — costing lives
- **How:** 8 AI agents surface disagreements transparently; humans decide with full context
- **Impact:** Faster triage, fewer missed contradictions, full audit trail

</div>
<div>

### Planet

- Optimized resource routing — fewer unnecessary dispatches, lower fuel waste
- AI camp placement avoids flood zones and protected areas
- Cloud-based — no dedicated hardware

</div>
<div>

### Profit

- **Model:** B2G contracts + SaaS for NGOs
- **Who pays:** FEMA, Red Cross, municipal emergency offices
- **Pricing:** Per-seat licensing + pay-per-event for smaller agencies
- **Scalable:** Any disaster type, any geography
